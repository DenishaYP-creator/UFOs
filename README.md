Please review the following files index.html & app.js. The Data source file data.js, CSS stylesheet, and image folders included.   
## Overview of the analysis: 

### Background: 
Our client Dana needs assistance with creating a website that displays UFO’s sighting. She has provided a data set with sighting information in various locations across the country.

### Purpose: 
The purpose of the UFO’s repository project is to showcase Dana’s new UFO sighting webpage. To help Dana showcase the data, we will utilize VS code editor to build and optimize a dynamic website that will allow the user to input and drill down on the specific information they seek.
To build the website, we will utilize the functionality of JavaScript to manipulate the data stored in a JavaScript array. In addition to Javascript interactive elements and D3 library, we will also use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to customize our website to appeal to the user. A significant component of the project is the creation of a table that will display results and filters that will allow users to refine their search base on a date, city, state, country, and shape. 
# Results: 
To the new OFO's webpage, a user can filter their search based on date, city, state, country, shape. The following images illustrate the results of filters.
### Filter By State

# Summary: 

Although the website looks excellent and utilizes the superb functionality of Javascript, one of the significant drawbacks that may impact the user's experience is linked to the filter data table. 

In the filter boxes, the Users' input does not account for whitespace; thus, when a user inputs text preceded by a space, the table may not populate correctly. 

In future development, the website should include images and videos that will further engage the user. Additionally, adding a call to action can ensure future visits to the UFO's sighting webpage.
